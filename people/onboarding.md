# Short Description
Onboarding answers the question, "how are you going to get a new, inexperienced Champion embedded into the Champions Program so they feel at home?".

# Long Description
When a new person becomes a Security Champion, they likely have no idea what to expect. If you only invite them to a monthly meeting, with no context for what they should expect, you are setting them up for failure. There is an opportunity with onboarding to welcome a new Champion and set them up for a long and successful time within the Program.
