# The Security Champion Framework

The Security Champion framework exists as a measuring stick and a roadmap. As a measuring stick, the framework allows leaders to measure how well their champions program performs. As a roadmap, the leader can use the measurements as input and build a plan to improve their program by applying updates towards a higher framework level.

## What's in a name?

Various names apply to the people that make up a security champion program. For example, organizations use different naming schemes for Champions, Advocates, Guild Members, Ninjas, and Agents.

There is nothing in a name. Instead, call the people within your program by any of the monikers provided. Do call them something, but choosing the perfect phrase to describe the people does not define the success of your program

For purposes of the framework, the word champion is used universally. 

## Overview of the Security Champion Framework

Five high-level areas divide the framework, with one to four sub-areas within each area.

| Area | Description |
